## Meeting Agenda

### 1. Creating Meeting Notes with AI (~15 minutes)

In this activity, **all team members** will learn how to use last week's Zoom transcript and AI to create meeting notes quickly.

#### Step 1: Open the Transcript
- Open the transcript file from last week's meeting (Team Meeting 1)
- If you don't have it, ask your note taker to share it now

#### Step 2: Use AI to Create Meeting Notes (All Members)
> **Everyone**: Each team member should try this on their own device.

1. Go to [ChatGPT Edu](https://www.csub.edu/ai/chatgpt/index.shtml) (free with your CSUB account)
2. Copy and paste the transcript
3. Ask AI to format it according to the [Team Meeting 1](team-meeting-1) template

**Example Prompt**:
```
Here is a transcript from our team meeting. Please format this into meeting notes following this template:

[Paste the Team Meeting Agenda template here]

Transcript:
[Paste the transcript here]
```

#### Step 3: Compare and Discuss
- Compare the AI-generated notes with last week's meeting minutes
  - You can download last week's meeting minutes from Canvas, or get it from last week's note taker
- Discuss as a team: How accurate is the AI output? What's missing or incorrect?

| Member | How accurate? | What's missing or incorrect? |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------|
| [Name 1] | | |
| [Name 2] | | |
| [Name 3] | | |
| [Name 4] | | |
| [Name 5] | | |

#### Step 4: Create Your Own Prompt
1. Each member: Edit the AI-generated notes to fix any errors or add missing information
2. In the same ChatGPT conversation, ask: "Based on my edited version, create a reusable prompt in markdown format that I can use for future meeting notes"
3. Share your prompt via Zoom chat to the note taker

> **Why Markdown?** Using a markdown-formatted prompt helps AI generate consistent results every time.

> **Note Taker**: Update the table below with each member's prompt shared in Zoom chat.

| Member   | Prompt (shared via Zoom chat) |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Name 1] |                               |
| [Name 2] |                               |
| [Name 3] |                               |
| [Name 4] |                               |
| [Name 5] |                               |
