# Updating Your Canvas Profile Photo and Biography

## Goal

We aim to enhance communication with students in Canvas by getting to know each other better. To achieve this, we aim to have students upload their photos and register their biographies on the Canvas platform.

## Why This Matters?

Beyond improving communication with the instructor, uploading your profile photo and completing your biography helps you connect more meaningfully with your peers. One of the key goals of this course is to build a strong network among students. By learning about each other's backgrounds, goals, and interests, you can form professional relationships that last beyond the classroom. These connections may lead to opportunities such as writing or receiving recommendation letters, referring each other to internships or job openings, or even becoming future colleagues. Building your network starts here by simply introducing yourself to your classmates. Taking a few minutes to complete your profile thoughtfully can help you stand out and foster a sense of community and support in the course.

> Hi! I'm Maria Garcia, a senior majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resource Management.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking in the Sierra Nevada mountains and volunteering at the local animal shelter. Fun fact: I'm fluent in three languages - English, Spanish, and Portuguese!

## Troubleshooting
