## Before Starting the Meeting

### 1. Note Taker: Download This Document
Download this meeting agenda as a Word document and use it to take notes during the meeting.
- Click **"Download Word Document"** at the top of this page

### 2. Update Your Zoom Name
Before the meeting starts, all team members must update their Zoom display name to **First Name Last Name** format.
- Example: "John Smith" (not "John's iPhone" or "JS")
- This is required for the transcript to correctly identify who said what

> **Note Taker**: Click the **AI Companion** button when the meeting starts. This enables the meeting summary to be sent to all co-hosts after the meeting ends.

> **Note Taker**: Assign all team members as **co-hosts** in Zoom. This allows everyone to receive the meeting summary.

### 3. Start Recording
> **Note Taker**: Since you created the Zoom meeting, please start recording at the beginning of the meeting.

After the meeting ends, you can download the **transcript** from Zoom. The transcript will show:
- Who said what (speaker identification)
- Timestamps for each statement

> **Why Record?** Next week, we will do an activity using AI to easily convert this transcript into meeting notes. This will help you learn how to efficiently create meeting notes for future meetings.

> **Don't worry!** The recording and transcript are for your team's use only. You do NOT need to submit them to the instructor. (You only need to submit a screenshot of the email sharing the transcript.)

### 4. After the Meeting: Share Transcript
> **Note Taker**: After downloading the transcript, share it with all team members via email.

1. Download the transcript file from Zoom
2. Email the transcript file to all team members
3. Take a **screenshot** of the sent email
4. Submit the screenshot to Canvas

> **All Team Members**: This transcript will be used for next week's activity. Please save the transcript file individually. If you don't receive it, ask your note taker to send it to you.

### Meeting Screenshot (Required)

> **Note Taker**: Take a screenshot during the meeting showing all participants in Zoom Gallery View. Paste the screenshot below.

**[Paste your Zoom Gallery View screenshot here]**

**Screenshot Requirements:**
- Zoom Gallery View showing all attendees
- Each participant's name displayed as "First Name Last Name"
- Meeting date/time visible (Zoom header or your device clock)

> **Warning**: Agendas submitted without a meeting screenshot will receive **zero points**. The screenshot verifies that your team conducted an actual online meeting.
