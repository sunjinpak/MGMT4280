## Overview

Each team is tasked with delivering a **25-minute summary** of their assigned module.

> **Note**: The time allocations for each section below are **approximate proportions**, not strict requirements. Feel free to adjust based on your content needs.

Teams are required to:
- Create a YouTube link for their presentation video
- Develop three discussion questions
- Post them along with the video link on the Canvas discussion board
- After posting, each team member must respond to at least **five comments**

**Related**: [Team Presentation Schedule](team-presentation-schedule)

## Create a Slide

### 1. Self-Introduction (~1 minute)
- Major, minor, concentration, and years at CSUB
- Activities in student organizations, work experiences, plans after graduation, and fun facts
### 2. Introduce Presentation Objectives (~1 minute)

### 3. Related YouTube Video (~3 minutes explanation)
- Select a relevant YouTube video (movie clips, news coverage, documentaries, etc.) to capture audience interest before diving into the module content
- **No time limit** on video length - even full-length movies are acceptable
- **Avoid lecture-type videos** (points will be deducted)

**Important: Do NOT play the video during your presentation** (copyright concerns)

Instead:
1. **Screenshot** the first frame of the video
2. Include the screenshot in your presentation slide
3. **Explain** why you selected this video and how it relates to your case or the laws you will discuss (it does not have to be directly related to the case)
4. Add the YouTube URL to:
   - Your presentation slides
   - Your YouTube video description
- Audience members can watch the video on their own time

### 4. Module Summary (~18 minutes)

**Step 1: Case Selection & Introduction**
- Choose one case from the end of your assigned chapter in [*Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment*](https://amzn.to/49xmOjo)
- Explain **why your team selected this case** (relevance, interest, real-world application, etc.)
- Provide a **brief overview of the situation** (1-2 sentences) without detailed analysis
- This introduction should naturally lead into Step 2 (Law Summary)

**Step 2: Law Summary (Before Case Explanation)**
- Using the two assigned textbook chapters ([*California Employment Law 2025*](https://amzn.to/3Z8fQwo) and [*Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment*](https://amzn.to/49xmOjo)), summarize the laws related to your selected case
- **Explain the differences between California Law and Federal Law**
- Only cover content directly linked to your selected case (not the entire chapters)

> **Bonus (+1 point)**: Share personal experiences or experiences of family/friends related to the law you are explaining to make it more relatable and engaging.

> **Example**: If assigned Module 2 (Worker Classification), refer to:
> - [*Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment*](https://amzn.to/49xmOjo) Ch 1 (Employment Relationship)
> - [*California Employment Law 2025*](https://amzn.to/3Z8fQwo) Ch 5 (Employees or Independent Contractors)

**Step 3: Case Analysis**
Use the **IRAC Framework** to analyze the selected case. For more details on IRAC, refer to [this guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_Z4nPnUqsGhMr2zcsheH6qPuN5RR1my7).

| Component           | Description                                       | Example (Case 1.1 Boston Scientific v. Mabey)                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **I - Issue**       | What is the legal question the court must decide? | Was the non-compete agreement enforceable due to lack of consideration?                                                                                      |
| **R - Rule**        | What laws or legal principles apply?              | Under Massachusetts law, non-compete agreements must be supported by "clear additional benefit" as consideration.                                            |
| **A - Application** | How did the court apply the rule to the facts?    | The court found that $3,000 additional bonus constituted sufficient consideration because Mabey, as an at-will employee, had no legal right to that payment. |
| **C - Conclusion**  | What was the court's decision?                    | Judgment for Boston Scientific. The non-compete agreement was enforceable.                                                                                   |

**Additional Analysis Points:**
- **Who are the parties?** (Plaintiff vs. Defendant)
- **What were the key facts?** (Timeline, employment status, compensation details)
- **What would happen under California law?** (Compare CA vs. Federal/other state law)
- **What are the practical implications for employers and employees?**

**Avoid merely reading from slides or notes**

### 5. Discussion Questions (~2 minutes)
- Create 3 discussion questions related to the case
- At the end of the presentation, introduce your three discussion questions
- Briefly explain their importance and how they connect to the module content
- **These questions will be used for team meeting discussions during the week**
- Presenters do not need to answer these questions during the presentation
- Use the prompt below to generate role-based discussion questions

**Prompt for Generating Discussion Questions:**
```
Based on the following case, create 3 discussion questions for a 4-person team meeting.

[Paste the case summary here]

Requirements:
1. Create 3 thought-provoking discussion questions related to the case
2. Assign roles to each of the 4 team members for role-based discussion:
   - Employee Advocate: Argues from the employee's perspective
   - Employer Representative: Argues from the employer's perspective
   - HR Manager: Focuses on policy implications, best practices, and facilitates discussion
   - Legal Advisor: Analyzes legal risks, compliance issues, and summarizes key points

3. For each question, suggest which roles should lead the discussion
4. Questions should encourage debate between different perspectives
5. Include at least one question about California vs. Federal law differences (if applicable)
```

**Example Discussion Questions (Case 1.1 - Boston Scientific v. Mabey):**

| Question | Lead Roles |
|----------|------------|
| **Q1**: Was $3,000 sufficient consideration for Mabey to give up her right to work for a competitor? How should employers determine fair compensation for non-compete agreements? | Employee Advocate vs. Employer Representative |
| **Q2**: As an HR Manager, what policies would you implement to ensure non-compete agreements are enforceable while maintaining employee morale? | HR Manager, Legal Advisor |
| **Q3**: California generally does not enforce non-compete agreements (Business & Professions Code § 16600). If this case occurred in California instead of Massachusetts, how would the outcome differ? What are the pros and cons of California's approach? | Legal Advisor, HR Manager (facilitates debate) |

> **Note**: The sequence of components is flexible.
