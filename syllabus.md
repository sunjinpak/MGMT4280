- PLO 1: Communication Skills
- PLO 3: Functional Knowledge
- PLO 4: Ethical Reasoning

## 3. Course Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand and discuss California specific employment and labor laws.
- Analyze and discuss leading HR hot topics and court decisions.
- Prepare for and facilitate group discussions.

- Understand and utilize CA State resources (Labor Code, DFEH, DIR, DLSE, etc.)

### Course Structure: The Employee Lifecycle Approach
This course is organized around the **Employee Lifecycle**, following the natural progression of an employee's journey through an organization. The modules are sequenced to mirror the stages an employee experiences, from hiring to separation. This structure helps you understand employment law not as isolated topics, but as interconnected legal issues that arise at different stages of the employment relationship.

| Stage                       | Module                                           | Week    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Hiring**                  | Module 1: Hiring Process & Selection             | Week 3  |
| **Classification**          | Module 2: Worker Classification                  | Week 4  |
| **Employment Relationship** | Module 3: Employment at Will                     | Week 5  |
| **Compensation**            | Module 4: Wage & Hour                            | Week 6  |
|                             | Module 5: Overtime                               | Week 7  |
|                             | Module 6: Meal & Rest Breaks                     | Week 9  |
| **Working Conditions**      | Module 7: Privacy Rights                         | Week 10 |
| **Workplace Issues**        | Module 8: Employment Discrimination              | Week 11 |
|                             | Module 9: Harassment                             | Week 12 |
|                             | Module 10: Disability Accommodation              | Week 13 |
|                             | Module 11: Leaves of Absence                     | Week 14 |
| **Separation**              | Module 12: Investigations, Termination & Retaliation | Week 15 |

By comparing **Federal Law** and **California Law** at each stage, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how California's employee-friendly regulations often exceed federal requirements. To facilitate this comparison, this course uses two textbooks: one focused on federal employment law and one on California employment law.

## 5. Instructional Strategies & Classroom Policies

### Office Hours, Appointments, and Email
My in-person office hours are Tuesday/Thursday 6:00-7:00pm & 8:15-9:15pm, and Friday 12:00-1:00pm. During these times, you are welcome to visit my office (BDC A137) without an appointment. Zoom meetings are available by appointment; please email me with your preferred time and I will do my best to accommodate your schedule. Use email to ask questions, clarify assignments, or request additional support. Always begin your email subject line with "[MGMT 4280]". I will respond within 24 hours if you follow this format.

> **FAQ: How do I write a professional email?**
> Before sending an email to your professor, use [ChatGPT Edu](https://www.csub.edu/ai/chatgpt/index.shtml) (free with your CSUB account) to review it with the following prompt:

### Class Updates
I will use the current syllabus or email to post important notes and due dates. Updates are also synced to Canvas. Please check your email and Canvas daily to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.

### Late Assignment Policy
Late assignment submissions will incur a 10% deduction per 24-hour period. Extensions may be granted at the instructor's discretion for documented emergencies.

### Technical Problems on Your End
You are responsible for keeping your computer up-to-date and fully functional. This includes regular maintenance, software updates, and ensuring your device is capable of handling online coursework and assessments without disruption. No extensions will be granted for computer or internet failures. Be proactive and plan ahead.

To avoid technical problems during assignments or exams:
- **Test your device in advance.** Make sure your computer, browser, and any required applications (e.g., Zoom, Google Docs, Canvas) work properly before starting an assignment or test.
- **Have a backup plan.** If your personal computer does not function properly, you are expected to use a reliable alternative—such as a **computer at the campus library**—to complete your coursework on time.
- **Ensure adequate storage.** Keep at least **10% of your computer's storage free**. During an exam or assignment, you may need to download files or temporarily store data. A lack of available space can cause your system to freeze or crash unexpectedly.
- **Maintain a stable internet connection.** Wi-Fi interruptions or disconnections will not be accepted as a valid excuse for late submissions. If your home internet is unreliable, please use the university library. Plan to complete your work well before the deadline to minimize risk.

### Policy on Final Grades
If you have any concerns about grading during the semester or if you feel that something is unfair, discuss it with me immediately. No discussion will be held to find a way to bump you from a "C" to a "B" or from a "B" to an "A." There will be no negotiation or changes to grades once the final exam period has begun. This includes requests for extra credit, regrading, or any form of individual consideration based on personal circumstances. Please make sure to monitor your progress throughout the semester and address any concerns before the final exam period starts.

### Subject-to-Change / Notification Process
I will work hard to stay on that schedule. However, life is unpredictable, so a contingency plan is sometimes necessary.

## 9. University Policies

### Instructor Initiated Drop Guidelines for Both Face-to-Face & Online Classes

Students on official university business who cannot attend the first day of class due to that business must notify the instructor of record prior to the first day of class. The student must provide proof of the official university business from the sponsoring program or office to the instructor of record.

Students who are administratively dropped under this policy will be sent an email by the instructor informing them of the drop. Students should not presume they will be dropped by their instructor for non-attendance under this policy. Students who have registered for a class, but never attended, should verify whether or not they are officially enrolled via their "myCSUB" account. It is ultimately the student's responsibility to withdraw officially from the class. It is the responsibility of all wait-listed students (face-to-face and online) to communicate with the instructor concerning readings and assignments that must be completed in the first week of class.

### Inclusiveness and Safety at CSUB

**Title IX**
CSU Bakersfield does not discriminate on the basis of gender, which includes sex and gender identity or gender expression, or sexual orientation in its education programs or activities. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and certain other federal and state laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation in employment, as well as in all education programs and activities operated by the University (both on and off campus), including admissions. The protection against discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual exploitation, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at: https://www.csub.edu/equity-inclusion-compliance/title-ix

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**
If you have a disability, which may require consideration by the instructor, you should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 661.654.3360. You must have an accommodations letter from the SSD office documenting that you have a disability; present the letter. It is not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability. I will make any reasonable accommodation.

**Military Personnel**
The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 protects post-secondary education students whose education is interrupted by voluntary or involuntary military service, and gives the right to readmission to the educational program. This applies to students who are members of the National Guard or Reserve called to active duty involuntarily or volunteers for an extended period of active duty, students who start an educational program (full or part-time) while on active duty and who then must interrupt the educational program because of a deployment or a Permanent Change of Station (PCS), and students who interrupts his or her education to enlist in a regular component of the armed forces. Such a person is entitled, as a matter of federal law, to resume the educational program later, either during or after the person's active duty service.

In order to comply with this law, if you currently have orders- or receive such orders during the semester- you are obligated to notify me and provide a copy of said orders as soon as possible.

**Correct Pronouns, Names, and Inclusion**
I fully support people of all gender expressions and gender identities and encourage students to use the name and set of pronouns which best reflect who they are. In this spirit, I welcome and expect all students to also use the correct name and pronouns of their classmates. I will do my best to respect and use the language you use to refer to yourself and will encourage other members of our classroom community to do the same. Please inform me if my documentation reflects a name or set of pronouns different from what you use, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact me after class, by email, or during office hours.

### Etiquette, Civil Discourse & Student Conduct

Students in this course are always expected to follow the CSUB Student Code of Conduct. If you are not familiar with the code of conduct, you can learn more about it here: www.csub.edu/osrr/_files/CSUB-Student-Conduct-Code.pdf

In addition, this course requires some specific rules for conduct. Net etiquette or "netiquette" is expected of all students who engage in course forums and discussions. "Netiquette" means that you should treat others with dignity and respect during your team interactions. Here are some "netiquette" rules for your course discussions:

- **Stay on topic & avoid personal attacks.** Respect and appreciate that others may have different perspectives than you. Focus on the topic being discussed and never make a personal attack.
- **Read before you post.** Re-read what you wrote twice before you post it. Is your comment clear, concise and to-the-point?
- **Pay attention to your tone.** Remember that sarcasm and some other types of humor can be misinterpreted in written form.
- **Cite your sources.** Cite sources, whether you are quoting directly or paraphrasing.

If you have any concerns about any student conduct during this course, please contact the course instructor.

### Academic Integrity

Certain forms of conduct violate the university's policy of academic integrity and the student conduct code. Academic dishonesty (cheating) is a broad category of actions that use fraud and deception to improve a grade or obtain course credit. Academic dishonesty is not limited to exams alone but arises whenever students attempt to gain an unearned academic advantage. Plagiarism is claiming the published or unpublished work of someone else as your own. This includes handing in someone else's work; turning in copied or purchased compositions; using paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words, or ideas, including paraphrasing, written by another writer; or using data and/or statistics compiled by someone else as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original writer. Plagiarism also includes using your work submitted in another class without permission of your current instructor.

When a faculty member discovers a violation of the university's policy of academic integrity, the faculty member will meet with the student(s) involved and is required to notify the Dean of Students' office and detail the alleged violation, including the name(s) of the student(s) suspected, the class in which the alleged violation occurred, the circumstances of the alleged violation, and the evidence (including witnesses) supporting the allegation. The faculty member will also formally notify the student(s) suspected of violating the university's policy of academic integrity, the department chair for the course involved in the incident, and the appropriate school dean. The Dean of Students or designee will investigate; confer with the faculty member, student(s), and any witnesses identified; and review all evidence submitted by the faculty member and student(s) to impose an administrative sanction, beyond the academic penalty already placed by the faculty member. Students who perform dishonestly in this course may earn zero credit on the assignment/exam or a failing grade in the course, depending on the level of severity of the offense.

Students are expected to uphold the standards of academic integrity. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated and will result in a formal report to the University Dean of Students. You are always expected to follow the student conduct code and uphold the CSUB Guiding Principles while learning on this campus.

### Catalog Statement

The principles of truth and integrity are recognized as fundamental to our campus community. CSUB administrators, faculty, staff, and students are expected to honor and uphold these principles and in so doing protect the integrity of all academic work. A degree at CSUB is a product of our campus's commitment to ethical behavior, academic integrity, and academic excellence. When a violation of academic integrity occurs, it diminishes the value of that degree. Students at CSUB are expected to do all work assigned to them without getting or giving unauthorized assistance. Faculty have the responsibility of planning and supervising academic work so that honest effort is encouraged and positively reinforced.
